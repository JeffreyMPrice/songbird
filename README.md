# songbird
Over the centuries, miners would carry canaries down into the mine tunnels with them. If dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide collected in the mine, the gases would kill the canary before killing the miners, thus providing a warning to exit the tunnels immediately. The SongBird framework is dedicated to those birds that provided safety and security for miners.
